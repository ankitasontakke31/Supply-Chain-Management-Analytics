📊 Supply Chain Management Dashboard – Power BI Project

✅ Project Overview
This project presents a Supply Chain Management Dashboard created using Power BI, which enables stakeholders to monitor and analyze key metrics such as total sales, costs, product performance, region-wise trends, and customer segments — all in one centralized, interactive dashboard.


🔍Business Problem
The company faced challenges in:

Tracking sales trends across states, regions, and stores.

Identifying low-performing and top-performing products.

Understanding customer behavior and purchase methods.

Lacking clear visibility into sales growth and regional contribution.


🎯 Solution
A dynamic Power BI dashboard was built to:

Visualize product-wise and region-wise performance.

Show Top 5 stores and Top 10 states based on sales volume.

Analyze sales growth trends over the past 5 years (2019–2023).

Provide insights into customer gender and region segmentation.

Monitor purchase method distribution to align strategy with buyer behavior.

🧠 Key Insights
West and South regions are most profitable, suggesting regional expansion opportunities.
